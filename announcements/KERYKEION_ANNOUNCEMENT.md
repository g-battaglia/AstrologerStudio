# 🚀 Announcing Astrologer Studio: The Professional Workspace powered by Kerykeion

Hello Kerykeion community! 👋

I'm thrilled to announce the official release of **[Astrologer Studio](https://astrologerstudio.com)**, a professional-grade astrology application built entirely on top of **Kerykeion** and **AstrologerAPI**.

For years, Kerykeion has been powering astrological calculations in the background. With Astrologer Studio, I wanted to showcase what's truly possible when you combine the precision of our engine with a modern, beautiful user interface.

## 🌟 What is Astrologer Studio?

Astrologer Studio is a comprehensive workspace for astrologers and enthusiasts. It's designed to be the ultimate reference implementation of Kerykeion, bringing its capabilities to life.

**Key Features:**

- **Complete Charting:** Natal, Transits, Synastry, Composite, and Solar/Lunar Returns.
- **Interactive Ephemeris:** Visualize planetary movements with timelines and tables.
- **Client Management:** A dedicated system to organize client data and history.
- **AI Interpretations:** Context-aware readings powered by Kerykeion data and LLMs.
- **Fully Customizable:** Multiple house systems, zodiacs (Tropical/Sidereal), and themes.

## 🛠️ Open Source & AGPLv3

Just like Kerykeion, **Astrologer Studio is Free Software** (AGPLv3).

**"Free" as in "Freedom"**: You are free to use, study, modify, and share this software.

This means you can browse the source code to see exactly how Kerykeion is integrated into a production-scale Next.js application. It's a great learning resource if you're building your own tools with our library.

## 🔮 Try it Out

You can access the hosted version at **[astrologerstudio.com](https://astrologerstudio.com)**.

Since the revenue from AstrologerAPI is still insufficient to work on this project full-time, I hope that Astrologer Studio will help the ecosystem become sustainable.

- **Launch Offer:** I have a special launch price of **$5/month**. This directly supports the continued development of Astrologer Studio, Kerykeion, and the API.
- **Self-Hosting:** Prefer to host it yourself? You can do that too! Check the docs for instructions.

Thank you all for your support of the Kerykeion project. I can't wait to hear what you think of Astrologer Studio!

Ad astra! ✨
